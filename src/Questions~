1. UNLINK
	What if multiple clients are reading a file and unlink is issued.
	What if multiple clients are writing to their private copies and the master copy
	is unlinked? Should a new master copy be created when the clients finish their
	write? Or the unlink should be blocked till all the writes are finished?
	
2. LRU
	The LRU time should be set at the time of open or close?
	What if the file-to-be evicted is also under use currently?
	File A opened and is being read
	File B opened and is being read
	File C is to be opened but no space. Evict file A but it is being read currently!
