The project implements various techniques to scale up a simulated, Cloud­hosted,
multi­tier web service (a web store front)

The system will simulate clients arriving at random intervals. Each client will perform one or
more “browse” requests, and may follow up with a purchase, but only if the replies are
received within a short time. The goal is to maximize the total revenue by ensuring short
response times, while minimizing costs (number of VMs running).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The main classes (Cloud, ServerLib, Database, ClientSim) and the sample
database file (db1.txt) are in the lib directory.  

A sample server is provided in the sample directory.  To build this, ensure
your CLASSPATH has the lib and sample directory included.  Then run make in 
the sample directory.  

To run the sample, try:
	java Cloud 15440 lib/db1.txt c-2000-1 12
This will launch the "Cloud" service, load the database with the items in 
lib/db1.txt, and start simulating clients arriving at a constant rate every
2000 ms.  A single instance of the sample Server will b erun as a "VM" 
(actually a spearate process).
